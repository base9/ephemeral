//POSTING A PHOTO: intended process
//client sends a GET to api/phots/addnew.  includes user id, event name, file extension, other details.
//server creates an entry in photos table. generates and returns presigned S3 URL to client.
//client then uses presigned URL to upload the photo to S3.
//if successful upload: just say 'photo uploaded!'
//if error: notify client that upload failed, and notify server so it can drop that recently created record.

//TODO: photo bucket currently allows anonymous read/write access.  refactor this.
//should allow credentialed read-write access (for dev environment - have api keys cached on dev machine)
//'When deploying, you should change the ‘AllowedOrigin’ to only accept requests from your domain.''

//images can be viewed by the client very simply, like this: 
//<img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/base9photos/UNIQUE_FILE_NAME.jpg'></img>
